🚀 Getting Started

cd ~/cyber-audit-blueprint/scripts
chmod +x *.sh
./recon.sh
./scan.sh
./simulate_attack.sh
./report_generator.sh

✅ Audit Steps

1. 🔐 Consent & Prep
Complete checklists/prep_checklist.md
Confirm devices, ISP setup, expectations

2. 🕵️ Reconnaissance
./recon.sh
Whois, nslookup, ARP scan, shodan

🔍 Vulnerability Scanning
./scan.sh
Nmap, Nikto, local ports + web interfaces

💣 Simulated Attack (Ethical)
./simulate_attack.sh
Hydra brute force (with test creds)

 🧠 Human Risk Training
Fill in checklists/training_review.md
Review phishing, password habits, device sharing

📑 Reporting
./report_generator.sh
Combine checklists into reports/final_report_template.md

🧠 Philosophy
Built using:
✅ NIST CSF
✅ CIS Controls (v8)
✅ Hacker tools + white-hat logic

“Don’t just scan, explain. Don’t just break, help fix.”
